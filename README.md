# SystemsModelData
A collection of data used in development of systems models for Salt Lake City, the Wasatch Front, and Utah

The purpose of this repository is to make data available for various systems modeling purposes. While systems modeling in the Utah Urban Water Research Group vary in purpose, detail, and extent, this repository serves as a central sharing point, which is helpful for the scales and parameters where there is overlap between the models.

Make sure data are uploaded into an appropriate folder or subfolder, and always include a metadata file with the following information:
* the website or entity who provided the data
* details about any manipulation, aggregation, transformation, cleaning, etc. or if this is the raw data

Name the metadata file with the following convention: dataname_metadata.md
For example, if streamflow data are uploaded in a file named "GagedStreamflow.csv", create a corresponding metadata file named "GagedStreamflow_metadata.md"
