# SystemsModelData
A collection of data used in development of systems models for Salt Lake City, the Wasatch Front, and Utah

The purpose of this repository is to make data available for various systems modeling purposes. While systems modeling in the Utah Urban Water Research Group vary in purpose, detail, and extent, this repository serves as a central sharing point, which is helpful for the scales and parameters where there is overlap between the models.
